# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for FlowCoach, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
Brownfield foundation built from an existing Python Slack bot (Socket Mode) that orchestrates Slack Bolt, Todoist, OpenAI services, plus a newer Node/TypeScript CLI stack (FlowCoach v2) using Claude and Todoist APIs. No external starter template; architecture evolved organically inside this repository.
